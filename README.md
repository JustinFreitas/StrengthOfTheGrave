Undead Fortitude v1.0, by Justin Freitas

ReadMe and Usage Notes

When damage is applied to an NPC or PC with the Undead Fortitude trait, the target will roll a constitution save with a DC of 5 + the damage taken.  If success, the target will be left with one hit point instead of dying.  If the damage type is at least part radiant or the hit is a critical hit, Undead Fortitude has no effect and will not be triggered (target will go unconscious, as normal).  This saves lots of time and frustration in zombie encounters for my ToA game because I'm not having to repeatedly fix HP and remove the unconscious effect in these big hoard fights we are running.

Changelist:
- v1.0 - Initial version.
